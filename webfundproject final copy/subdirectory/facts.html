				There are 3 main types of elephants: <u>the Asian elephant, the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant.</u>
				African bush elephants are the largest of the elephants and have large flappy ears.

				the <u>lower frequency vocalizations and foot stomping of elephants resonate</u>, allowing them to communicate through
				seismic waveforms <a href="references.html">[2] </a>
